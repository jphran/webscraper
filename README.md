With all the hype, it's becoming harder and harder to create an inventory 
bot. It'd be cool to get this running but I need a job first. And the 
longer I spend on this, the more I think about the ethics of what I'm doing.
Even though I only want a single GPU for training algos and playing Apex in 
4k, am I any better than the people that put me in this position in the 
first place? Next up AI tracking software
